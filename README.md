# SpigotCorpseNPC1.17
From CodedRed's Video on CorpseNPCs. 

I figured I'd try to save them to a data.yml and use a config.yml to check how many times you're clicked on it to disable clicking on it twice, bug fixes and updates coming!

CURRENT BUGS:
BUGs:
1:
When rejoining the server, the corpse reappears, this was part of testing that I was doing, plan to fix that when I get time.
I'm going to try to save info to a config.yml or something before I save to a data.yml when I can remove the NPC. 

UPDATES: 
Save NPC's to a data.yml, should fix bug #1.
